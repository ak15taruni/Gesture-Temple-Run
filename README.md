# Gesture-Temple-Run

Dive into a new era of gaming with my groundbreaking project that combines cutting-edge technology, MediaPipe, and Pose Detection to automate endless running games. 🤖💃

In today's dynamic gaming landscape, it's not just about playing; it's about redefining how we interact with our favorite titles. 🚀🕹️ This project comes as a response to the evolving expectations of gamers worldwide.

Imagine the thrill of controlling popular endless running games like Subway Surfer and Temple Run with your very own movements! 🏃‍♂️💨 The integration of Pose Detection technology opens up a realm of possibilities, providing a seamless and immersive gaming experience that goes beyond traditional controls.


🌐 Application in the Real World: This project is not just a technological showcase; it's a practical application that brings a touch of the future into our daily gaming adventures. The excitement lies in the realization that what was once science fiction is now a tangible and exhilarating reality.
